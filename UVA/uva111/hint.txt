Here is a hint for this problem:

This problem can be solved either with Longest Common Subsequence or Longest Increasing Subsequence. For reference, these are the link to the algorithms found on Wikipedia. 

Longest Increasing Subsequence:

Longest Common Subsequence:

In my solution, I use Longest Increasing Subsequence. The function lis() which represent this process is written pretty much the same as the pseudo code from LIS on Wikipedia.
